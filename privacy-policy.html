    <h1>Pavé Routes, LLC Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected,
      used, and shared when you interact with our our mobile application (the
      “App”).
    </p>

    <h2>PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>

    <p>
      When you interact with the App, we automatically collect certain
      information about your device, including information about your web
      browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the cookies that are installed
      on your device. Additionally, as you browse the App, we collect
      information about the individual pages that you view and information about
      how you interact with the App. We refer to this automatically-collected
      information as “Device Information.”
    </p>

    <p>We collect Device Information using the following technologies:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        “Log files” track actions occurring on the Site, and collect data
        including your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider,
        referring/exit pages, and date/time stamps.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Additionally when you sign up for the app, we collect certain information
      from you, including your name, and (if you purchase a subscription)
      billing address, payment information (including credit card numbers, email
      address, and phone number). We refer to this information as "Account
      Information.”
    </p>

    <p>
      When we talk about “Personal Information” in this Privacy Policy, we are
      talking both about Device Information and Account Information.
    </p>

    <h2>HOW DO WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h2>

    <p>We use this Order Information to:</p>

    <ul>

        with information or advertising relating to our products or services.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      We use the Device Information that we collect to help us screen for
      potential risk and fraud (in particular, your IP address), and more
      generally to improve and optimize our App (for example, by generating
      analytics about how our customers browse and interact with the Site, and
      to assess the success of our marketing and advertising campaigns).
